1. hello.py is a test file, whether pushing to a repository works
2. signals.py contains create_sine_wave, a function which generates a sine wave based on the frequencz and duration which can be manipulated
3. run.py creates a plot based on the first 10 samples of generated by the signals.py with a specific frequencz and duration
